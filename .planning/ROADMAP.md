## Overview

Build a Go CLI for complete Gmail mailbox management via service account authentication. Start with project foundation and auth, then implement read operations (list, search, threads), followed by write operations (send, drafts, delete), finishing with polish (attachments, formatting).

### 🚧 v1.2 Headless Login (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Enable OAuth2 login on headless machines (EC2, SSH, containers) via device authorization flow

#### Phase 8: Device Authorization Flow

**Goal**: Add `--no-browser` flag to `gsuite login` using RFC 8628 device flow
**Depends on**: v1.1 complete
**Research**: Unlikely (`golang.org/x/oauth2` has built-in device flow support)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01: Implement device authorization flow (`--no-browser` flag, device auth method, CLI integration)
